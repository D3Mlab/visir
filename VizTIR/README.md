<h1> Viz-TSF: A Visual Twitter Search Tool based on Query-driven Filter Optimization </h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
Geo-temporal visualization of Twitter search results is a challenging task since the simultaneous display of all matching tweets would result in a saturated and unreadable display. Thus, the development of novel intuitive visual interfaces is necessary to help focus a user’s attention by filtering information relevant to their query. In this work, we propose a Visual Tweet Search Filter (Viz-TSF) tool for query-driven optimization and ranking of spatial, temporal, and content-based filters to help focus a user’s exploration of search results. We leverage a fast greedy optimization algorithm to optimize an approximation of expected F1-Score metric to generate these filters and demonstrate its application to search 2 years of Twitter content, specifically for a user’s information need related to natural disasters occurring in the US. Our demo shows that Viz-TSF is capable of extracting geo-temporally coherent filters given search queries, thus aiding the user in visually searching and browsing social network content and enabling new opportunities for the application of Information Retrieval techniques to general visual information exploration interfaces.
