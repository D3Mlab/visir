\begin{abstract}
% Clustering for results aggregation, but unlike purely unsupervised learning where might use K-Means, in this use case we have a relevance signal that can be used to refine clusters according a user's information need.
%Many applications such as real-time monitoring of social network activities or urban traffic congestion reports involve high information and cognitive load tasks.  In this context, it is common to have large-scale information visualization interfaces to concurrently display system status, alerts, and events.  However, displaying all information elements simultaneously would result in a saturated and unreadable display.  

\textcolor{red}{Geo-temporal visualization of search results is a challenging
task since the simultaneous display of all matching elements would
result in a saturated and unreadable display.
Thus, the development of relevance-driven clustering methods for Visual Information Displays (VIDs) are required to help focus the user's attention by restricting the display to information relevant to their query using highly relevant clusters showing multiple information perspectives.  
In this paper, we make key contributions to the literature on relevance-driven clustering for VIDs: (1) Given that a VID will typically support many types of clustering parameters }(spatial, temporal, and content), we provide a unified framework that abstracts presentation-specific details and facilitates an optimization perspective of clustering.  
% NOTE: Should be some sort of property like monotonicity of result counts that somehow can be exploited in filter design.
(2) Within this optimization framework, we argue for the formulation of 
%Given a probabilistic relevance indicator for content importance, we provide a 
clustering as maximization of an expected F1-Score (EF1) objective subject to parameterized cluster constraints.
%that can be maximized via mixed integer linear programming or efficient, approximately-optimal greedy algorithms.
% In this work, we argue that information-filtering task is central to a variety of VSIs and well-suited to an Information Retrieval (IR) perspective where we argue that a good overall objective for filter selection is F1-Score; given the absence of known Boolean relevance labels for interface elements, we instead propose optimization of a surrogate metric of expected F1-Score denoted as EF1.  
And (3) specifically for optimizing clusters w.r.t.\ EF1, we contribute two efficient greedy algorithms as well as an \emph{optimal} Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation intended to benchmark the performance of the greedy approximations on moderately sized datasets. 
\textcolor{red}{We evaluate our algorithms by an off-line study and a user survey. In the off-line study, we experiment with a scenario related to searching natural disaster discussed in a collection of tweets} under a variety of settings where we vary the amount of data, noise, and relevant vs. irrelevant class imbalance in the ground truth data.  We show that EF1 is a good surrogate for optimizing F1-Score and the proposed greedy algorithms are a good approximation of the optimal MILP solution, yet much more scalable. \textcolor{red}{ In the user study, we analyze the feedback of 24 students asked to find the natural disasters using our algorithm and two different baselines.} 
In summary, this work provides the first formal and unified perspective of relevance-driven clustering for VIDs from an F1-Score optimization perspective along with scalable and robust algorithms that demonstrate strong performance when benchmarked against optimal results.
%we hope this work helps better connect IR and AUI research, bringing a general and formal IR perspective to this important research area while opening new research directions for the application of IR methodology to AUIs.
%the community to realize the potential of the information retrieval approach to address AUIs problems.
