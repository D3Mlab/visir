Many search results can be naturally displayed on a map or other interactive visual interface.  However, given the massive volume of available information in many applications (e.g., thousands of geolocated tweets that match a query), displaying all relevant results for a given query would often result in a saturated and unreadable display~\cite{Landesberger2011,Liu2014,Sun2013}.

% However, it can be time consuming to individually examine all matching results.  In such settings, it has long been acknowledged that aggregating or clustering search results can help a user sift through large amounts of information (Scatter-Gather).  However, to date, aside from using a search query to filter results, these existing approaches tend to use unsupervised clustering methods like K-means that ignore relevance scores of documents during clustering.

% However, in this paper we note that potentially important information is being ignored when performing clustering for search results, i.e., the clustering is unaware of document relevance scores and clustering does not optimize results for user presentation (e.g., geometric regions, etc).  Ideally we would like to find spatially and temporally coherent (among other criteria) clusters that maximize the amount of relevant information contained in the cluster.

% Traditional search engines such as Google or Bing display search
% results in a vertical list of textual summaries, which is certainly not adapted for search results of geo-temporal data such as Twitter data or Foursquare Data. Moreover, given the massive volume of available
% information in many applications -- for instance social media such as Twitter, displaying all relevant elements for a given
% query prevents the visual extraction of relevant information as it
% would result in a saturated and unreadable display ~\cite{Landesberger2011,Liu2014,Sun2013}.
%In high information and cognitive load tasks such as real-time monitoring of network security, social media monitoring, or urban traffic congestion, it is common to have large-scale visual interfaces to display current system status, alerts, and events~\cite{Landesberger2011,Liu2014,Sun2013}. However, the massive volume of content to be presented on these Visual Information Displays (VIDs) prevents the simultaneous presentation of all information relevant to each alert or event~\cite{Liu2014}. 

However, in many settings (e.g, event-driven data that might frequently occur in searches of social media), it is often natural to assume that search results may cluster into spatially, temporally, and topically related content that can be aggregated and presented as a single unit rather than individual results.  
Such approaches leverage the \emph{cluster hypothesis} of information retrieval~\cite{Salton1971,Jardine1971,Voorhees1985,Manning2008}, which posits that documents in the same cluster should behave \emph{similarly} with respect to information needs.  
%Thus clustering may help organize and unclutter the search display and ensure that the user is provided with different information perspectives (i.e., clusters) that provide coverage of diverse aspects of the relevant search results.

\end{figure}

To make the task of clustering in visual information retrieval more concrete, we introduce an example scenario.
Consider the case of searching a multiyear Twitter corpus for content related to natural disasters.  
% tornado, blizzard, earthquake
As shown in Figure~\ref{Fig:GlobalDisplay}, a typical visual approach would be to provide all matching tweets in an interactive visual interface.
%We denote all displayed content (in this case individual tweets)
%(such as user IP address, Tweet content, Tweet time, geographical coordinates, recent activity details) 
%as an information element that could
%be optionally shown or not.  
Clearly in this case, displaying all matching tweets simultaneously
results in a saturated and unreadable display that will take the user a large amount of time to sift through. 
To ease the task of browsing search results, a clustered results display like that shown in Figure~\ref{Fig:FilteredDisplay} can be used to restrict the displayed information to highly relevant clusters that cover a large fraction of relevant content. 
%Since results in clustering-based visual information retrieval interfaces are not individually selected, 
%Hence it is critically important to define a clustering objective that optimizes for relevance, coverage, and visually coherent presentation of the clustered search results. %, which is the focus of this paper.

Most existing work on aggregation in interactive visual search that has sought to exploit the cluster hypothesis has focused on K-means and related \emph{unsupervised} clustering methods~\cite{Ahlberg1995,Liu2014,Sankaranarayanan2009,Teitler2008,Bennamane2012,Shneiderman2013,Yifan2015,Smith2009} that do not necessarily guarantee that the clusters themselves are relevant.  To address this deficiency, we make two novel contributions in this paper in the context of clustering for interactive visual search: (1)~we seek to develop novel clustering methods that directly and efficiently optimize the relevance and coverage of clusters, and (2)~we provide novel cluster definitions that reflect notions of spatial, temporal, and keyword coherence. 

%To this end, we design a novel relevance-driven clustering optimization objective and develop a fast greedy algorithm to approximately optimize it.  
To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to address clustering in interactive visual search as a relevance-driven, partially supervised optimization problem.
Overall in this paper, we make the following key contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We provide a unified clustering framework that defines clusters in terms of presentation-specific cluster attributes (spatial, temporal, and content) and which facilitates an optimization perspective of clustering w.r.t. a provided relevance measure.  
% NOTE: Should be some sort of property like monotonicity of result counts that somehow can be exploited in filter design.
\item We propose new \emph{expected} metrics for optimization based on conventional information retrieval metrics, i.e., precision, recall, and F1-Score.  We argue that expected F1-Score (EF1) is the appropriate metric to optimize subject to parameterized cluster constraints.
%\item We argue for the formulation of filtering as the optimization of an expected F1-Score (EF1) objective subject to parameterized filter constraints.
%that can be maximized via mixed integer linear programming or efficient, approximately-optimal greedy algorithms.
% In this work, we argue that information-filtering task is central to a variety of VSIs and well-suited to an Information Retrieval (IR) perspective where we argue that a good overall objective for filter selection is F1-Score; given the absence of known Boolean relevance labels for interface elements, we instead propose optimization of a surrogate metric of expected F1-Score denoted as EF1.  
\item For scalable and efficient cluster optimization w.r.t.\ our EF1 objective, we contribute two greedy algorithms.  We show that the greedy approach based on a binary cluster partitioning scheme performs best.
\item To benchmark the performance of the greedy algorithms for EF1 optimization on moderately sized datasets, we compare to an \emph{optimal} Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for EF1.
%derived from an initial fractional MILP formulation.
%\item We propose a new theory of IR for adaptive visual user interfaces. 
%\item We propose a relevance-driven F1-Score optimization approach to filter selection for AUIs.
%\item We propose two new filter setting search algorithms based on greedy strategies. These algorithms are based on the optimization of EF1-Score.\item \textcolor{red}{We define an optimal Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation for EF1 intended to benchmark the performance of the greedy approximations on moderately sized datasets.}
\item We present an offline comparative evaluation on a Twitter corpus to show that the greedy algorithms we propose are a good approximation of the optimal solution, better than the state-of-the-art clustering method K-Means, and perform well in the presence of noise (i.e., corruption of the ground truth labels).
%can even perform better with a noisy classifier \textendash{} up to 42\% improvement for a classifier with an accuracy of 60\%. On the other hand, 
We also experimentally demonstrate that the EF1 metric is a good surrogate of F1-Score (if true relevance labels were known).
%specifically with a highly accurate classifier \textendash{} for a classifier with 90\% accuracy, the RMSE is roughly 0.0111).
\item We comparatively benchmark this new algorithm in offline experiments and further undertake a user study with 24 subjects to evaluate whether this new relevance-driven clustering method improves human performance on visual search tasks in comparison to K-means clustering and a non-aggregation baseline.
Our results show that clusters derived by maximizing EF1 of presentation-specific cluster attributes result in faster user search task completion and higher accuracy compared to K-means and the non-aggregation baseline.

% ====================================================

%%Thus, clustering search results search can help to scan a few coherent groups of elements than many individual elements. Clusters represent different information perspectives related to a query and supply the user a clear and a quick overview of the search results without necessarily having to browse the matched elements.

% Clustering in Information Retrieval (IR) is based on the  assumption that if there is an element from a cluster that is relevant to a search request, then it is likely that other elements of the same cluster are also relevant~\cite{Manning2008,Jardine1971,Voorhees1985}. This is because clustering puts together elements that share many terms.

%However, in practice, in many applications such as social network posts, relevant elements are likely to not share always similar terms. 

% However, in practice, because the relevance signal is ignored, irrelevant elements are inherently mixed with relevant ones in clusters, which impacts the quality of the results.  Therefore, it is critical to develop relevance-driven clustering methods for Visual Information Displays (VIDs) that are capable of displaying highly relevant clusters for each query.



%Such filters allow the user to efficiently investigate the cause and implications of the alert or event, to identify critical properties of all the elements involved, and to initiate appropriate corrective actions in a timely manner.

%Going back to 1992, Belkin and Croft~\citep{Belkin1992} realized that information filtering was simply a counterpart to information retrieval, albeit with a few key differences.  Namely, Belkin and Croft pointed out that 
%In this work, we argue that this information-filtering task is central to a variety of AUIs. \textcolor{red}{Therefore, we expand on the information filtering paradigm of Belkin and Croft \citep{Belkin1992} where the key difference from standard Information Retrieval (IR) is that rather than focusing one-short query-driven interactions,
%information filtering often occurs in the context of a long-term standing interest (represented implicitly through a relevance measure), as well as continuing interaction with the filtering system over a long period of time.  
%While this accurately summarizes the filtering perspective we take in this paper, we remark that most work on information filtering displays has so far focused on \emph{unsupervised} approaches such as (hierarchical) clustering~\cite{Ahlberg1995,Liu2014,Sankaranarayanan2009,Teitler2008,Bennamane2012,Shneiderman2013,Yifan2015,Smith2009}.  However, returning to Belkin and Croft's initial motivation and information retrieval analogy to information filtering, we assume a task-specific relevance measure and ``supervised'' relevance objective in order to generically view information filtering in VIDs as an expected F1-Score optimization of a result set given filter constraints.

%However, we work with a richer paradigm in that we incorporate multiple filters for different contexts including content, time, and geographical regions.  %Ultimately these filters often align with a visually coherent presentation.
%Unlike clustering which is mainly unsupervised, filtering does have a notion of relevance.
%Also, the main difference with clustering which is unsupervised, in this work, filtering does have a notion of relevance (or label).
%}




%Furthermore, we argue that the filtering task shares many common properties of a standard Information Retrieval (IR) setting as \textcolor{red}{summarized in \citep{Belkin1992}.  Also, Belkin and Croft \citep{Belkin1992} highlithed important differences between ranking documents in web search and filter selection} for AUIs, especially in the way that documents in the AUI can only be selected for a result set through filter settings.
%However there is also substantial overlap and formal connection with many aspects of IR thus providing   
%especially in the indirect selection of AUI results through filter %settings. Hence this unexplored field 
%provides new possibilities for cross-pollination 
%new opportunities and challenges of research in this IR setting for AUIs.



%The key difference is that while information retrieval is ubiquitous in the lives of most humans in the form of web search, it has gone virtually unrecognize as an appropriate model for the filtering problem in AUIs \textcolor{red}{[REFERENCE IS NEEDED]}. 
%Instead, machine learning methods have been widely used to address this problem.

% Consider the case of searching natural disasters that are discussed on Twitter, using the query ``tornado, blizzard, earthquake'' on a geo-temporal search engine.

%to be provided by a third-party since this prediction is highly specific
%to each particular application setting and not the focus of this work (see Related Work in Section 6 for further discussion). }
%In this work, we intend to
%focus on the broader problem of AUI filtering in a range of visual
%display applications assuming this relevance predictor is given. However,
%in addition to scoring information elements of direct causal interest
%to the alert, it is likely that the AUI will also contain other related material requiring
%the concurrent display of information.  For example, such a material could be messages exchanged, the time at which these messages were exchanged, etc.
%For example, such a rule could
%be \textquotedblleft if a connection is shown, the IP addresses of
%the two connected machines must also be shown\textquotedblright ,
%which would trigger additional (soft) constraints for the filter optimization.

% Since ``retrieved'' information

% While this notably diverges from the standard information retrieval setting
% where ranked documents are chosen individually~\cite{Baeza-Yates2010}, these additional constraints
% do not change the overall objective to select
% relevant information given the user's information need as represented by the given relevance measure. 

%Furthermore, standard information retrieval evaluation benchmarking
%methodology (e.g., the Cranfield paradigm) and metrics such as precision@k
%or average precision are also relevant here (assuming that visual
%saliency can serve as a surrogate method for achieving a visual rank
%ordering of selected information elements).  Unlike information retrieval
%where Boolean metrics such as F-Score are not often used since ranked
%lists are usually limited to the top-10, graphical displays can present
%substantially more information of varying sizes that make precision-recall
%trade-off metrics like F-Score also relevant for evaluation.\textcolor{red}{ [THIS SENCTENCE IS UNCLEAR]}
