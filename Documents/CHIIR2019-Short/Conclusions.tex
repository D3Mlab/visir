%Overall, we aim for this work to bring a formal IR perspective to the important research area of AUIs while opening new research directions for the application of IR methodology.  As information
%retrieval has transformed our web experience, we believe there is
%a similar opportunity to transform the present nascent state of AUIs
%through optimization and information retrieval principles to make
%them more ubiquitous in our daily lives. 



%In this paper, we have expanded on the information filtering paradigm of Belkin and Croft \citep{Belkin1992}, by  

In this paper, we introduced and experimented with a novel formulation of relevance-driven clustering for visual information retrieval.
%as a ``supervised'' optimization problem given a measure of relevance for information elements along with fast greedy algorithms to optimize this novel formulation.  
Overall, our combined offline and user-based experimentation results demonstrate fast, near-optimal greedy optimization and that the higher-relevance clusters extracted by this method result in faster user search task completion and higher accuracy compared to K-means and a non-aggregation baseline.

% Overall, this work underscores the need to rethink the role of clustering methods and optimization in interactive visual search interfaces.

% We have motivated and derived the expected F1-Score as an objective criteria for relevance-driven cluster optimization.% and we have experimentally demonstrated that the proposed expected F1-Score metric is a good surrogate of the ground truth F1-Score.

% We introduced a novel relevance-driven clustering optimization algorithm for expected F1-Score based on a greedy strategy.  We have also proposed a method for optimization of expected F1-score using a MILP approach that has critically allowed us to benchmark the greedy algorithms on moderate-sized datasets. The off-line evaluations we have performed on a Twitter of datasets have shown that the Greedy algorithm is relatively efficient and provide a good approximation of the optimal MILP solution. % Somewhat surprisingly, we remark that greedy methods like BPS may even do better than exact expected F1-score optimization in high noise cases due to their more restricted search space, which prevents overfitting to this noise. 
% The user study we carried out confirmed the outcome of the off-line evaluation and have demonstrated that the clustering based approach is effective for our search scenario, and most importantly, that our relevance-driven clustering algorithm allows fast, accurate and smoothy search.

%Furthermore, we should also consider novel application-specific objectives, e.g.,  in specific visualization frameworks. % or based on a ranking theory of results presentation (e.g., using size or color for visual ranking emphasis).  


% For future work, we are currently integrating these algorithms into our existing user interface of graph exploration and mining. We also plan to conduct a user study in the context of natural disasters discussed on twitter to analysis our algorithms and get a real insight of their accuracy. Finally, we plan to investigate new optimization metrics based on visual rendering.
